# üîß DC Motor Speed Controller using SCR and TCA785

## üìù Project Summary

This project demonstrates the **design, simulation and building** of a DC motor speed controller using a **silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR)** and the **TCA785 integrated circuit**. The system enables precise speed control through **pulse width modulation (PWM)** and supports both **manual adjustment** and **automatic regulation using a PI feedback controller**.

All circuits are simulated using **Altium Designer**, providing practical verification of design functionality and system behavior.

Successfully implemented the motor speed controller on a physical prototype, confirming simulation results with real-world performance and consistent, precise speed regulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

### üí° DC Motor Characteristics

- The **speed** of a DC motor is directly **proportional to the applied voltage**.
- The **torque** is directly **proportional to the armature current**.
- Direction control is achieved by reversing the polarity of either the **field winding** or **armature**.

- Motor speed is controlled using **phase-angle control** of the input AC via SCRs.
- The **TCA785** IC performs waveform generation, synchronization, and PWM generation.
- A **manual control unit** adjusts speed via a potentiometer or analog signal.
- A **feedback loop** compares actual motor speed with the reference and adjusts the SCR firing angle accordingly using a **PI controller**.

## üß© System Architecture

### 1. **Power Supply Block**

- Converts **12V AC, 50Hz** into:
  - **+15V DC** to power the TCA785 control IC.
  - **¬±15V DC** for operational amplifiers and analog circuits.

### 2. **Control Circuit Block**
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/tca785.png" alt="tca785" width="500">
</div>
- Built around the **TCA785 IC**, which performs:
  - Synchronous voltage generation
  - Sawtooth waveform generation
  - Comparator function
  - Pulse output generation for SCR triggering

### 3. **Pulse Transformer Block**

- Provides **galvanic isolation** between the control and power circuits.
- Prevents damage to the controller during short-circuit or high current surges in the load.

### 4. **Power Stage (SCR-based Driver)**

- Uses **thyristors (SCRs)** to modulate the AC power to the DC motor.
- Firing angle is controlled via TCA785 output.

### 5. **Feedback and PI Control Block**

- Feedback voltage is derived from a tachogenerator or voltage sensor proportional to motor speed.
- A **PI controller** (implemented with op-amps) adjusts control signals based on error between setpoint and feedback.
